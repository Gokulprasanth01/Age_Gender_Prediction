# Gender and Age Prediction - Image Classification - CNN

# Dataset Information

UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.

The objective of the project is to detect gender and age using facial images. Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images. There are 2 output types namely, gender(M or F) and age.

## Neural Network

-> CNN Network
       - CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network, which is a type of artificial neural network commonly used in image and video recognition tasks.
       - In a CNN, the input image is passed through a series of convolutional layers, which apply a set of filters to the image to extract relevant features. These            features are then processed by one or more fully connected layers, which perform the classification task.
